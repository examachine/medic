First Draft

Medic is a library for medical imaging and communications implementing the DICOM 3.0
standard by NEMA. (1) The library has been written in C++, and is licensed under
the GPL. (2) Medic stands for 'MEDIC Extends DICOM Imaging and Communications' since
its main goal is to achieve an edible interface that makes developing DICOM
conforming applications sane and to provides a comprehensive and robust framework
for medical imaging applications. Since the DICOM applications have
usually been tremendously expensive, the hope lies that quality free software
DICOM applications will take advantage of this library.

History

Medic has been developed at the Electronics Engineering department of Bilkent
University, Ankara as part of the PACS (Picture Archiving System) project named
RAGARIS (Radyolojik Goruntuleme ve Arsivleme?) The library was then called the DCL,
which stands for Dicom Class Library. Although the project was an absolutely closed
source one, it has always been the author's intention to put it under GPL's terms.
Unfortunately, it was not clear how it could be achieved. Following a speech given
by Richard Stallman at our faculty, our project supervisor suggested that we did so.

DCL was implemented as static libraries in Microsoft Visual C++. Nevertheless, the
translator and the first batch of libraries that implemented DICOM functionality
were developed on a Debian GNU/Linux system. An advantage of the library
has been that platform independence was not compromised by making the software too
dependent on proprietary software (In this case Win32 platform and MFC) Thus the
MFC functionality was wrapped with a smaller static library, consisting mostly of
multithreading and TCP/IP code. Porting to the GNU system began on 26th on the September, and the entire port has taken only x days.
