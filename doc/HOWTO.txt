
CTEmu: a DCL Example App
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

CTEmu is an application which emulates the various DICOM operations conveyed
by a CT modality. The example demonstrates how to use DCL for implementing a
DICOM Application Entity.

The project settings and the source files must be configured so that

+ The application uses MFC as a shared library

+ Exception handling and RTTI is enabled

+ Runtime library set as MultiThreaded DLL (debug - for Debug release)

+ The include paths ..\dcl-kernel\src, ..\kernel mfc lib\src, ..\dcl-gen are specified (*)

+ The libraries ..\lib\dcl-kernel.lib, ..\lib\dcl-kernel-mfc.lib, ..\dcl-base.lib are specified (^)

+ The preprocesor directive

#include <DCL.hxx>

  is specified in all C++ source files which refer to the libraries.

+ The application initializes the DICOM subsytem by calling

    dicom_app.init_class();

  as the last statement of InitInstance() method of your main application class derived from
  CWinApp.

+ The following preprocessor directive is present in your '.rc2' script

#include "..\kernel mfc lib\DCL Resources.rc"

+ The application runs in the ..\dist directory in order to access the configuration and storage
  files

Under compliance with these conditions, your application should compile and run
successfully as a DICOM Application Entity.

Optionally, you are recommended the following:

+ In order to improve the build time, append the following include directive
  to the StdAfx.h file (+)

#include <DCL.hxx>

+ Inserting the compiler directive

#pragma warning(disable:4804)

in your StdAfx.h will provide cleaner builds

+ You can control the dicom console as in the following code fragment (which is typical of
menu event handlers)

void CDCLApplicationView::OnViewDicomConsole() 
{
	CMenu* menu = AfxGetMainWnd()->GetMenu();

	if (menu->GetMenuState(ID_VIEW_DICOM_CONSOLE, MF_BYCOMMAND) & MF_CHECKED) {
		dicom_app.hide_console();
		menu->CheckMenuItem(ID_VIEW_DICOM_CONSOLE, MF_UNCHECKED);
	} else {
		dicom_app.show_console();
		menu->CheckMenuItem(ID_VIEW_DICOM_CONSOLE, MF_CHECKED);
	}
}

Notes:
*  However, any application specific include paths would precede DCL paths.
^  If you would like the debug versions use dcl-kernel-debug.lib, dcl-kernel-mfc-debug.lib
   and dcl-base-debug.lib
+  Of course provided that the precompiled headers are set accordingly.
