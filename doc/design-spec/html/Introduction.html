Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Through many years of worldwide experience of digital medicine, a standard
known as DICOM has emerged. The standard is a thorough collection of
documents which determine many aspects of operation and communication of
devices which support digital imaging in medicine. It has been the de facto
industry standard for years and the most recent one is DICOM 3.0 that was
published by NEMA in 1997.

<P>
In brief, the standard directly addresses the communication, storage and
retrieval of medical imaging data, and other aspects of digital systems such
as a patient information system and printing. It is not the purpose of this
report to duplicate the numerous definitions and protocols of the DICOM
standard in this document. Rather, the reader is encouraged to refer to the
standard itself. Though lengthy, many of the main issues are to be best
found in the 14 parts of the standard. The emphasis of this document is on
our design and implementation of DICOM 3.0.

<P>
The standard is based on an object oriented information model to be able to
account for the conceptual depth and flexibility required by a medical
imaging system. The message passing (over TCP/IP), distributed, persistent
object system makes realization of a versatile and sizable PACS possible.
Once dealt appropriately DICOM makes things easier. However, DICOM itself is
fairly big: the current implementation supports the 24*5 primitive data
types (see PS3.5), 895 attribute types (see PS3.6), 103 information module
classes, 35 information object classes (composite and normalized, see PS3.3)
and 25 messages (see PS3.7). Obviously, DICOM represents many technical
challenges caused by its sheer complexity. Clear design directions had to be
taken, and most features of the standard have been successfully implemented.

<P>
This report describes the library by first
elucidating the design issues. Consequently, we 
report an overview of architectural components and supply a class
reference at a medium level of detail which furnishes insight into the
implementation.
