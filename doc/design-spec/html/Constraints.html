<P>
The library presupposes a rather modest hardware/software setup. We
assume no more than baseline development tools and standard
libraries. In the platform independent portion, we use only ANSI C++
and its standard library. On GNU platforms, the GNU toolchain and
standard socket and thread libraries are utilized. The Visual C++
version uses MFC for all functionality.

<P>
The framework is compiled as either a static or shared library
according to the platform. On Visual C++, due to compiler and linker
peculiarities we have to build a static library. The framework
has a simple invocation consisting of only a single initalization
entry point.

<P>
The resources used by MEDIC are quite standard, we make use of
file, TCP/IP, multithreading and timer services from underlying OS
through appropriate APIs.

<P>
The library is a fairly complete implementation of DICOM and it
implements 11 of the 13 volumes of DICOM 3.0 standard. Since it
uses TCP sockets, the reader is referred to RFC's
detailing TCP/IP protocol.

<P>
Interoperability is achieved through DICOM communications over TCP/IP.
MEDIC implements only synchronous mode transfers because there does not
seem to be a good framework for writing convenient asynchronous code
in C++.

<P>
Each Application Entity is supposed to run on a single machine. A
DICOM Application Entity has a persistent store of DICOM objects
and distribution is achieved through DICOM store, get and move
commands.

<P>
No security measures are taken as we simply assume that anyone
who can make a TCP connection is a trusted party and the system
is open in the sense that it has been designed as an Internet
application protocol. Security against malicious attacks can
be arranged simply by putting critical services inside a private
IP network that is not visible to outside world and placing
public access services on a node that is visible to whole Internet.

<P>
The implementation has no hard limits in the tradition of
modern system software. There are however user settings
that may be mentioned here. First, the implementation requires
free secondary storage to store persistent objects. The maximum
memory and disk space used by persistent store is also set by the
user. User can also set the maximum number of open connections
to DICOM server.

<P>
Since the application runs in a single user process space, 
message passing overhead is very low. Furthermore, 
binary encoding/decoding is performed on the fly enhancing
performance. The only bottleneck we have observed is
the stdio and iostream implementation on WIN32 platforms.

<P>
The applications that use the library have been tested using
Agfa DICOM Validation Tool and DICOMTK. Also, the library has
been stress tested during the development and testing of
RAGARIS PACS applications.
