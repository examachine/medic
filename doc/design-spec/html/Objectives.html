<P>
Indeed, a DICOM implementation is about realizing an object system
with the characteristics previously mentioned. The main goal of
a DICOM implementation is interoperability. Nevertheless,
interoperability has a cost. Internal representations will have to
be converted to interchangeable representations, the application
will have to implement complex protocols in order to communicate
with other DICOM applications, and behave accordingly to the standard.
For instance, images will be converted from platform specific display
memory to a complicated DICOM object which encapsulates many
attributes about an image having a binary representation
specified in the standard, and vica versa.
Likewise for non-image information such
as study data or reports. This entails in itself providing mandatory
attributes, and a host of binary parsing and generation code at
various levels <A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot20"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A>. The object representations maintained this way are
useless without specifying an operation on them. Typically, one
stores, fetches and manipulates this data on a distributed system
connected with TCP/IP or stores them on storage media such as CD-R.
In doing that each target has its own protocols. Processing over
the network requires conforming to an OO RPC protocol which is the
focus of DICOM3.0. Most services are defined this way, and besides
requiring a plentitude of message passing semantics and a large
protocol FSM, each one has its own service semantics. For instance,
when another application stores an image object on us we should store
it in a persistent way which may be accessed later. Writing and
reading storage media requires directory and file services which also
demand the same attention. Basically the interoperability cost is
incurred by the code that maps application semantics to DICOM
semantics. A DICOM object has many essential features. For instance,
it needs to have a class and instance UID. Having to specify these
special features and communication/storage code is arduous in
traditional implementations. The development cost is further increased
by diminished reliability and poor maintainability of bloated code.

<P>
MEDIC aims to cut down this cost by enhancing DICOM development with
an advanced application framework. There are recurrent themes
throughout the implementation. First, each used feature of the
standard is translated into a first class construct in the host
language. That is, we deliberately avoid having anything remotely
similar to various <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ad hoc</SPAN> object models that are constantly
being promoted recently. If there is a class, it is a class in the
language. If there is a type, the implementation is a type in the
language. We stick to exact translation, semantics already present
in the implementation language are used and not augmented with
auxiliary and inferior systems. The second theme is minimizing user
code length. Whatever DICOM task the user wishes to perform, he should
be able to accomplish it with a very short amount of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">abstract</SPAN>
code. In the user codes, we give attention to optimizing the common
cases and still giving a high level of freedom to the programmer.

<P>
This being said, we should clarify the design goals mentioned. MEDIC
has the following design goals. In the following text, we describe
in what way the design goal is required and how we have achieved it.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>portable</STRONG></DT>
<DD>DICOM applications may be implemented on a wide range
of hardware. Dependence on a particular architecture and operating
system would not be desirable. Although most of the development has
been done on Windows, we have taken care of portability by minimizing
and isolating Windows specific code. The platform independent part
is totally standard C++ and compiles with no difficulty on many
platforms already.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>comprehensible</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The biggest disadvantage of DICOM is its
size. With so many concepts and symbols to keep track of, programmer
soon gets drowned in the non application specific parts of coding.
We obtain ease of use by taking advantage of object oriented
programming. The interface classes are highly abstract and every
feature in the standard is readily accessible. For instance, changing
an attribute in an IOD is accomplished by a single line
of code which is a usual C++ method call. Sending an image over
network is another one-liner.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>efficient</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Whenever there are advanced functionality such as
 message passing and persistence, it is possible
to implement it very slowly. In a medical imaging application,
efficiency is cruicial because we have to deal with very large
volumes of data at a high rate.
The library has well tuned code that does
not have any significant overhead which arises from the amount of
abstraction. We use generic programming internally to capture
code similarity rather than less efficient object oriented programming
techniques where necessary. The efficiency however comes not
from avoiding advanced C++ features as they are used where they have
been useful. It comes from the fact that we do not resort to an
artificial type or object system that is not under compiler control
and optimization. When we decode an object, all that is done is
executing plain C++ code on the fly which gives us equivalent
performance to any hand written DICOM parsing routine. Another example
is the way we treat DICOM data types, one can create a VR on stack
or heap, as he wishes; similarly for coarse grained data types such
as modules or IODs.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>extensible</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Since this is an evolving standard, the
  implementation must be extensible in almost every aspect. In the
current implementation, it is quite easy to add new DICOM classes,
transfer syntaxes and services simply by plugging in required classes
into the code.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>rigorous</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Most DICOM implementations suffer from incompleteness.
 This is not the case with MEDIC because we employ a compiler that
 generates dataset coder/decoders and an object oriented decomposition
 has been used to enforce mandatory behavior while still allowing
 optional behavior. As a result, we have not yet found many DICOM
 dataset or command that have not been successfully processed by
 our implementation nor has many of generated datasets or commands
 have been interpreted as erroneous by other implementations. We have
 of course spotted bugs in the development which we have fixed and the
current state of the library is quite rigorous in that respect. All
protocol violations depicted in the standard are explicitly checked
and reported if encountered. Thus, for instance it is impossible to
process a faulty dataset: we do not do any sort of fuzzy parsing, but
it is also impossible to send an incomplete object over the network.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>reliable</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In most other implementations, we see that the
object model is implemented external to the host language and a lot
of awkward function calls are required to do even the most basic
operations. That is not the case with MEDIC, because almost every
operation is through first class constructs which means that strong
type checking, and other reliability features of C++ are fully employed.
</DD>
