System Overview</A>

<P>
MEDIC is a library that aims to be a complete and conformant
implementation of the DICOM 3.0 standard. It is assumed throughout
the document that the reader is familiar with the standard and its medical
applications; no further attempt will be made to explain the issues within
the scope of the standard. Since the standard explicates protocols and
behavior, leaving the implementation details unspecified, there is a host
of choices for the implementor to make. In particular, one chooses
which subset of the standard he shall aim to implement, which platform
the implementation is going to work on thus how application software
will use it for DICOM compliance.

<P>
MEDIC achieves this by a faithful translation of the standard to
a library that is a collection of programming interfaces which
are invoked by DICOM applications. It has been meant to be a portable,
comprehensible, reliable, efficient, extensible and rigorous implementation.

<P>
It is a framework under which application programmers write DICOM
code conveniently. When an application works with MEDIC, 
it behaves as a DICOM Application Entity  which can interoperate
with other Application Entities. Basically, it allows the programmer
to manage DICOM objects <A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot14"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>, and apply various
DICOM operations including operations over TCP/IP and media storage.
The design exclusively tries to hide implementation details from the
user, and gives him abstract services. That's where MEDIC extends
DICOM. For instance, any application entity started automatically
becomes SCP for most service classes as well as SCU. Many difficult
aspects of the implementation are not presented to the user, for
instance all association happens automatically and user sends commands
over an association with simple constructs.

<P>
In summary, MEDIC implements majority of the standard, excluding
most notably OSI upper layer services and legacy 50-pin connection
which are both obsolete.
