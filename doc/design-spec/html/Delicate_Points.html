<P>
Unfortunately, the library is not at the point of perfection, so future
tasks have to be enlisted. The fleeting descriptions may not be exhaustive,
nevertheless they elucidate the crucial issues.

<P>
Modulewise operations which work at the level of an information module are
required. By these operations, one should be able to tell existence of a
module (so that the application programmer may interpret which role an
object has taken), copy, extract or move a module with the module classes.
The mutually exclusive parts of some IOD's should also be considered at
this stage. The MUTEX keyword in the class generator is handled rather
awkwardly, that should be refined also. The handling of mutually exclusive
parts would make the system superlative.

<P>
Handling pointer identifiers better in IOD::add_module() is suggested.
Although no conflicts arise, pointer identifiers should be checked for
collisions.

<P>
50xx and 60xx Repeating Groups are discarded altogether, for they stand as
ad hoc mechanisms in the standard. Developer should Decode/Encode Repeating
Groups appropriately, probably by putting in a flag in auto-gen Attributes
and handling of repeating groups in Transfer Syntaxes. As the standard
suggests, repeating groups are to be replaced by ordinary sequences, so the
wisest solution is to represent repeating group modules as sequences, then
while decoding/encoding perform suitable conversions.

<P>
Conditional Requirement Types are omitted currently, those types are coerced
into optional ones. Of course that should be corrected by making an
extensive condition mechanism. The most common condition is the existential,
so that must not make much of a hardship for the classgen.

<P>
For the time being, first attribute of each module is scanned, and if they
are not there, a skip flag for that module is set, which makes decoders of
that attribute optional. Collisions do not have to be handled separately
with this scheme.

<P>
The compile-time coders are a good idea, however it has little flexibility.
The current scheme disregards error recovery while parsing. On any error,
including even the slightest of protocol violations, the system comes to a
halt and throws an exception. The solution comes from enriching the
metaclass information within dataset classes. In the auto generated classes,
there is attribute information, adequate to some extent: one can dump an
attribute's properties. Still and all, the information is not tied in. The
ingenious course is to write a decoder/coder method for each attribute and
relate them with static member pointers for each attribute which are,
surely, contained in a static data structure of the coder class which are in
parallel with the attribute container in the dataset class. Thereupon, the
library developer may translate some of the compile-time mechanisms to
run-time, getting a bit more freedom of action. The resulting coder is a
ephemeral algorithm which iteratively parses each attribute (in the encoding
order) from the data structures just mentioned, and handles some of the
exceptions appropriately, cushioning the application programmer from
frequent DICOM disasters.

<P>
On careful inspection of library internals, one is likely to find some flaws
with the streaming technique. There are unfortunately two methods for
streaming, one depends on some internal private routines in MFC extension,
and the other uses custom stream buffers. The stream buffer approach is more
elegant, and the former must be replaced by it. Meantime, it would be
incredibly useful to draw a base class for stream buffers and derive
specializes input and output stream classes. Despite the peaceful execution
of stream routines, these measures should be taken.
