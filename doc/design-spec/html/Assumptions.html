Assumptions</A>
</H2>

<P>
The implementation platform is already set as Windows NT / Microsoft Visual
C++, so our software has to respect the selection. As an object oriented
language, C++ is a suitable candidate for a DICOM implementation. Our
software, named MEDIC, is designed to be close to
ANSI C++, bearing as little dependency on VC++ as possible.

<P>
At any rate, MEDIC has been designed to be highly portable and thus
we assume no hardware platform. We anticipate that the library can
be made to run on top of any POSIX or WIN32 API which encompasses
a wide range of hardware from embedded applications to workstations.

<P>
The library audience is medical application programmers who require
DICOM compliance in their software. The library is nicely packaged
for both GNU toolchain and Visual C++ so that programmers can quickly
browse the source code and tutorial examples and integrate
MEDIC functionality in their applications rapidly.

<P>
Since DICOM is continously evolving, we may expect to account for
corrections and supplements to the standard. In the natural course,
all final versions of the standard and essential drafts will be supported.
