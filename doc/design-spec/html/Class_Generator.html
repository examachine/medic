Class Generator - Base</A>

<P>
The first problem was the number of SOP Classes (see PS3.4) in DICOM. There
are so many data structures with complex data types that it is almost
impossible to code them in C++ in a straightforward manner. Instead, one
must manage the structures slightly differently. There are really two
choices: either one may write a run-time class system or generate
compile-time classes. Using an auxiliary run-time class system is partly
discarding the benefits of an object-oriented language, in this case C++.
Furthermore, using the MFC run-time class system does not make things
easier. It is not a matter of efficiency but rather a matter of
comprehensibility and reliability that forced us to choose a compile-time
system. Then, a compiler has to be written. The Class Generator compiled our
versions of the long data sheets of the standard into many appropriate C++
classes. These classes are generated at the aggregate level, utilizing the
interface of primitive data types and basic encoding and decoding schemes.
By proper object oriented design, one may define the interface prior to any
programming: we have followed the same method by writing a compiler that
generates such classes prior to implementation of core DICOM functionality.
This method has also assisted us in determining what basic functionality is
ever required. The high level components in base module are
illustrated in figure <A HREF="Class_Generator.html#fig:classgen">2</A>.

The major use of this approach was that the system was flexible, efficient,
understandable and reliable. The system proved to be flexible because adding
or removing a class or attribute was no burden. One could augment the class
system as quick as he could read it. Efficiency comes from the ability to
make use of built-in static C++ mechanisms such as inheritance instead of
implementing a custom one. The system was comprehensible because the adapted
classes were, in the interface, no worse than a typical C++ class; the DICOM
information model was translated at exactly the same level that it was
intended. Surely, reliability is a result of moving some operations like
type checking to compile-time; then, one can be sure that he is accessing
the right data type. Adapted classes, combined with a persistence mechanism,
is suitable for implementing DICOM SOP classes.

<P>
The output C++ code has classes named after information modules and IOD's.
A top level class contains attributes (with their types denoting their Value
Representation and Value Multiplicity, see PS3.5), selector and modifier
methods, string representation methods, and availability checking methods
for each attribute, nested Coder classes with all Transfer Syntaxes
supported. An IOD inherits from abstract super classes of its modules. The
IODs do not just aggregate the attributes from their modules, but inherit
their abstract interfaces. Also, sub-level classes were generated to be able
to implement the nested sequences (described in PS3.5). In addition to this,
the compiler handles mutually exclusive modules and DICOM pointer types. We
have made use of genericity features of C++, as well. The template mechanism
enables better setting of some of the key abstractions. We would like to
explain some of the abstractions at this stage. ``VR'' denotes a Value
Representation name such as US or AT in the following definitions.

<P>
<code>Coder&lt;class TS&gt;</code> classes These classes are responsible for the
encoding of an adapted DICOM class with a transfer syntax denoted by
TS. They are embedded within the class which they encode.

<P>
<code>VR</code> Value Representation with Value Multiplicity 1

<P>
<code>VRf&lt;int arity&gt;</code> Value Representation with a fixed Value Multiplicity of `arity' (ex. 3)

<P>
<code>VRr&lt;int lower, int upper&gt;</code> Value Representation with a Value
Multiplicity in the range lower-upper; i.e  1-10.

<P>
<code>VRv</code> Value Representation with a variable Value Multiplicity (1-N)

<P>
<code>VRe</code> Value Representation with an even variable Value Multiplicity (1-2N)

<P>
<code>Seq&lt;class SQ&gt;</code> Nested Sequence of sub-class SQ

<P>
The generated classes make use of standard C++ library for ease of use and
efficiency. Specifically, the boolean vectors Coders use are template
specialization vector&lt;bool&gt; classes.

<P>
Note that these classes are not declared within the generated code, but in
the other modules. The generated code is only a client of these classes. The
C++ programs are then compiled into a library module called MEDIC Base.
