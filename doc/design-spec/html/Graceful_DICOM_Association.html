Graceful DICOM Association</A>
</H3>

<P>
All DICOM application entities must implement the DICOM Protocol Machine.
The machine is convoluted in nature, and works by passing by PDU's
according to a FSM. The establishment and closing of the association is very
important and must be tested severely, since all DICOM operations depend on
a live association. The protocol machine in MEDIC has been implemented in an
elegant fashion, however it has incomplete parts. For a graceful association
every possible move of the protocol machine must be handled and caressed.
Effectively, the ARTIM timers and presentation context passing is missing in
the MEDIC protocol machine. However, since the infrastructure is complete,
little work remains. In the case of ARTIM timers, in some events a timer
must be started, and the time-out causes the connection to close. The timers
were not required for the test purposes, so they were omitted. However
implementing the timers is not tricky. A single NT timer should be allocated
at all times, with the other timers handled via timer queue. (NT has a
limited number of timers) For presentation context implementation, only the
associate client and server methods in the DTCPContext have to be dealt
with. The associated PDU's are in majority complete, and plugging in a
presentation context in the DTCPContext class must not be much of a problem.
On that occasion, the PDV list passing must also be completed to full
operation and efficiency.

<P>
Another advise would be separation of DTCPContext into a client class and a
server class. Moreover, clustering DICOM Service Groups into corresponding
classes is a good idea. Print Management has been done in that fashion.
