Getting C-GET Done</A>

<P>
DICOM C-FIND and C-GET services demand a lot of attention whilst
implementation. These services are in fact simple query services, with the
C-FIND reporting what instances have been found, and C-GET returning
instances themselves. However, there is more to the discussion. Firstly, the
query services have a slightly alternate decoding/encoding for the
indication of keys to command the query, this combined with the wildcard and
range matching specifications make a significant burden. Secondly, and more
important than the previous issue, the information model must suit the
C-FIND/C-GET query model. The minimum implementation of the query services
demand a patient rooted hierarchical information model with a wide choice of
keys from each level of the hierarchy. The database developed for our PACS
system, indeed has a hierarchical model as required, but plenty of the keys
are missing.

<P>
The clever thing to do is to think in terms of client and server. The client
part needs a way to indicate any kind of query that can be made. This could
be over a special dataset, which goes into the query definition of the
request message. Also, the client must collect the response is composed of
multiple response messages into a simple structure and present them to the
application programmer. The server side is more elaborate, however, it seems
as though a single SQL statement construction is possible. As the keys are
interpreted, one by one, the single statement could be grown iteratively to
match the query. When, as the result of the query, instance UID's of the
requested SOP instances are retrieved from the database, they can be cast
into the response. According to the type of service (the query service
C-FIND, or the retrieval service C-GET) ID's or instances themselves are
emitted. The bottleneck here is the interpretation and forming of the SQL
statement. Quite elaborate handling of the query types and codings is
required, also the database must be tuned to fit the queries
