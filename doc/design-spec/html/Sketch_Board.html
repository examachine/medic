<P>
The MEDIC is the result of our vision of a robust system that employs DICOM,
therefore the library has not been pictured as a black box which supports
some of the standard but rather as an animate company to it. The
architecture naturally exposes some deficiencies, however it is our belief
that they can be remedied with little labor. The developer must reckon that
the object-oriented design should be maintained, with the class semantics
closely paralleling that of concepts in the standard. Whenever the rational
connections dissolve into daily fixes, the library must be revised. We have
considered that the primary issue is to facilitate the making of DICOM
compliant application programs: the conformance of the library is not
sufficient by itself. Then, the features that an application programmer
anticipates should be in the library. One implication of this statement is a
rule of minimal usage, the application programmer expects to give only the
required information to a subsystem, that is he wishes to confront a slim
interface, with the chance of selecting beyond default modes of operation.

<P>
As seen in some example code fragments in the DICOM documents, a programmer
wants to open an association, command some DICOM messages sequentially , and
shut it down; besides there is a high contingency that he would like to
direct the objects in a smooth fashion. We concede then, that the programmer
must be able to perform all these tasks simply and efficiently. The MEDIC is
adjusted towards making common operations easier while allowing fancier
ones. We have first concentrated on the object system, inheritance
relations, abstract classes and methods, information retrieval and
manipulation, then moved on to decoding/encoding, message passing and
application framework, always taking these aspects of design into account.
